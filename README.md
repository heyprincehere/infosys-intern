# Team-4-TATA-Online-Retail-Analysis-
 This project analyzes the business performance of an online retail store to provide insights for strategic planning. It focuses on revenue analysis, marketing effectiveness, and demographic metrics to help optimize product offerings, marketing strategies, and customer segmentation for future growth.

Project Road map
1. Data Loading & Cleaning
Preprocessing:
Load dataset, remove duplicates, and handle missing values (impute with mean/median/mode). Ensure correct data types (numerical, categorical, datetime).
Visualization:
Check dataset structure, plot feature distributions, and identify data patterns.
Outlier Handling:
Detect outliers using boxplots, IQR, or Z-scores and decide whether to remove or cap them.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Normalize data and conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. Generate an EDA summary with visualizations, feature relationships, and actionable insights.
3. Feature Engineering & Clustering
Feature Engineering:
Create time-based features, customer metrics, and dummy variables. Transform features (log, square root) for skewed data and assess feature importance.
Clustering Analysis:
Normalize features and implement K-Means clustering. Use elbow or silhouette methods for optimal clusters and visualize results.
5. Model Building & Evaluation
Model Building:
Split data into training and testing sets, and train a Random Forest model with hyperparameter optimization (using grid or random search). Handle class imbalance if necessary and save the trained model.
Evaluation:
Evaluate model performance using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared for regression tasks. Assess feature importance and compare performance across validation datasets.
7. Final Adjustments & Business Recommendations
Model Refinement:
Review clustering results, reassess model performance, and implement feature tuning for improvements.
Business Recommendations:
Provide actionable insights on customer segments, seasonal trends, and sales forecasts. Offer strategies for customer engagement and growth, along with a report summarizing key visualizations and trends.
